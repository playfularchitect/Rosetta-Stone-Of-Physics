Sorry folks! 
I miscounted one MDL term: R_21_31 was tallied as 7 bits instead of the correct 8.
This repo keeps the original files intact; Instead I have simply appended a new “Patch Module v1.1” at the end of the code to fix the count and print PASS flags + a seed checksum.

Run the patched version here! (shared Colab):
