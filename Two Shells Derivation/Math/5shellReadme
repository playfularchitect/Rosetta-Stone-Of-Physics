# 5-Shell Note ‚Äî Scope, Status, and How It Fits

**What this is.** `5shell.pdf` is a *working theory note* that documents multi-sector extensions to the two-shell framework (center-holonomy / non-abelian contributions, running ledger, and geometry-robustness checks). It is meant to **motivate** and **explain** terms that go beyond the baseline abelian Pauli-kernel computation.

**What it is *not*.** It is **not** the reproducer for the currently released Pauli-only number. The public, methods-complete, reproducible pipeline for the two-shell Pauli result remains the ‚ÄúMaster Output/Code Cell‚Äù + artifacts in this repo (`angles_*.csv`, `denominator.json`, `pauli_integrals.json`, `pauli_tilewise_bounds.json`, `alpha_prediction.txt`) and the disk-only verifier (`Wesley_VERIFY_README.md`, `verify_summary.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`).

## Relationship to the Baseline Release

- **Baseline (Pauli-only, abelian):**  
  Deterministic map  
  `angles ‚Üí locked denominator (Œ£ NB¬∑cos¬≤Œ∏ = 6210) ‚Üí multiplicity-weighted Pauli integrals ‚Üí c_Pauli ‚Üí Œ±‚Åª¬π = 137 + c_Pauli/137`,  
  shipped with certified intervals and a disk-only verification script.  
  *This is the number you can reproduce today.*

- **This note (multi-sector, non-abelian extensions):**  
  Documents center-symmetric ‚Äúcorner‚Äù projections (SU(2), SU(3), ‚Ä¶), their **parameter-free** contributions, cross-lattice robustness (SC/FCC/BCC style checks), and how these feed a **running ledger** of additional terms.  
  *These pieces are theory-complete on paper and will be integrated into code in a later release.*

## Contents at a Glance (what `5shell.pdf` covers)

- Derivation of **center-holonomy corner projections** and their mapping into the same `c`-normalization used by the Pauli pipeline.  
- **Running ledger**: how SU(2), SU(3), ‚Ä¶ center pieces add (sign and magnitude), with clear separation from the abelian Pauli term.  
- **Geometry-robustness** checks (cross-lattice arguments) indicating these center terms are not artifacts of a particular integer shell embedding.  
- Discussion of **gauge/rotation invariants** that justify using these contributions in the same ratio structure that defines `c`.

## Claims vs. Non-Claims

- ‚úÖ **Claimed here:** a self-contained mathematical derivation for each added center term, and a coherent scheme for aggregating them in a running ledger compatible with the Pauli normalization.  
- ‚ùå **Not claimed here:** that the combined (Pauli + multi-sector) prediction equals CODATA. Agreement/disagreement remains an empirical question; this note is about the *derivation* and *structure* of the added terms.  
- üî¨ **To be tested publicly:** uniqueness/ablation of the specific shell geometry under a stated isotropy criterion; full code integration of the non-abelian terms; and end-to-end certified intervals including these additions.

## How to Use This Note Today

1. **Reproduce the baseline** with the shipped artifacts (see `Wesley_VERIFY_README.md`). This validates the locked denominator, the Pauli integrals, and the reported intervals without any long runs.  
2. **Read `5shell.pdf`** to understand where the *additional* (non-abelian) contributions come from, how they are normalized, and how they will be plugged into the same ratio architecture.  
3. **Track the ledger**: until the corresponding code is published, treat ledger additions from this note as *documented theoretical inputs* that are pending code-level certification.
