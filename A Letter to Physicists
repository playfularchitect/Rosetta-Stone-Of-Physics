To the professional physics community,

I want be clear: I am not asking anyone to believe my theory.

I am asking you to recognize that the methodology and the mathematical results are a separate, immediately useful toolkit. This framework's motto is "the math is the math" for a reason. You can set aside the "Unmath" and "Paradox Dynamics" essays and still benefit from the tools my work provides. This isn't about belief; it's about utility.

My work offers a better way to do science, even if my physical claims are ultimately proven wrong. Here's how:

1. A Toolkit for Perfect Reproducibility
My paper, "Why you should use Fraction Physics," details how replacing floating-point approximations with exact rational numbers eliminates compounding errors. This guarantees that a calculation performed in a lab in California is bit-for-bit identical to one performed in a lab in Geneva. This isn't a theoretical benefit; it's a practical solution to the reproducibility crisis, and you can adopt this method in your own work today.

2. A Framework for Extreme Falsifiability
My ledgers provide a set of precise, unambiguous, and high-stakes predictions, such as sin(2β) = 119/169 and the pre-registered next digits of the fine-structure constant. These are not vague claims; they are designed to be broken. This feature makes our collective search for truth more efficient by providing sharp targets.

3. An Engine for Triangulation
Most importantly, this methodology provides a powerful way to navigate experimental uncertainty and accelerate discovery. Instead of slowly shrinking error bars around a continuous range of possibilities, my framework allows us to plant sharp, mathematically exact "lampposts" in the dark.

My neutrino ledger is the best example of this. It provides distinct, competing rational models for the different mass ordering scenarios. As future experiments gather data, they won't just be measuring a value; they will be actively testing and eliminating a series of clean, rational hypotheses. A "miss" becomes as valuable as a "hit" because it cleanly rules out a region of the parameter space, allowing us to triangulate the right answer faster.

So, I am not asking you to abandon your theories for mine. I am asking you to use my results as a benchmark. Use my rational number for α as a reference point in your next QED calculation. Compare your next experimental result for a CKM parameter against the exact fractions in my ledger. Clone the GitHub repository, run the code, and see the numbers for yourself.

The tools are on the table. They are transparent, verifiable, and designed to make our shared scientific endeavor easier, faster, and more efficient. You don't have to believe the philosophy to use the math.

Respectfully,

Evan Wesley
