READ THIS BEFORE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF

I cannot believe I have to spell this out, but here we go.

THE PAVLOVIAN “NUMEROLOGY” REFLEX

Let us start with the most pathetic behavior of all:

Some of you see structure you didn’t produce.
Some of you see precision you can’t derive.
Some of you see something unfamiliar.

And the only fucking word your pathetic brain coughs up is:

“Numerology!”

Not because you engaged with the evidence.
Not because you checked a single result. 
Not because you have a clue what MDL or null-models even are.

No — it’s purely because you are trained like a dog.
A sound you don’t recognize?
Bark.

It’s embarrassing, yall.
A lot of you are not doing physics.
You are not even thinking at a basic level. 
A lot of are openly displaying your conditioning with pride.

MEMORIZATION IS NOT INTELLIGENCE

Manipulating equations ≠ understanding them.

Most of you don’t even know where the equations come from.
You just parrot them, grind through them, and feel smart because you can solve homework problems someone else invented and validated.

So when someone actually goes deeper than your textbook —
down into the logic underneath the math —
your brain just fucking blue screens.

Then you pretend your confusion is evidence of my error.

It’s not.
It’s evidence of your limits.
Do better.

CREDENTIAL WORSHIP IS UTTERLY PATHETIC

Let me be very blunt:

If this exact work came stamped with “MIT / CERN / IAS,”
half of you would be on your knees praising it as revolutionary.

The math could be identical.
The results identical.
The compression identical.

But your behavior? Instant reverence.

Because a lot of you don’t evaluate ideas.
You evaluate logos.

This is not scientific literacy.
It is intellectual servitude and a lot of you are in love with the collar you put on yourself. 
If you need a logo to think, you’re not a scientist....you are nothing but a consumer.

THE “FIRST PRINCIPLES” CLOWN MOVE

I have had some of you shout “SHOW ME A DERIVATION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES”

…but you don’t even fucking know what “first principles” means.

To you, “first principles” means:
“Start where my textbook starts.”

If it’s deeper than gauge theory?
If it’s earlier than the Lagrangian?

Your entire mental stack overflows.

You are not demanding rigor. You will not even look at the evidence. 
You just want something familiar enough to pretend you understand it. 
It is absurd.

STATISTICS: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FAILED

I ran 3,000,000,000,000 (3 trillion) random universes.

ZERO matched.

That’s not subtle.
That’s not ambiguous.
That’s not “maybe random.”

That is p ≈ 0.

And the response I get from certain kinds of "geniuses"?

“How do you know it’s not random?” Or "But that can not be true this is not how you do physics, this is not in the textbooks"

So how do I know its real? How do I know it is not random? 

Because I know basic math.
Because I know probability.
Because I actually tested the shit out of it instead of blindly talking out of my ass.

If you cannot interpret significance beyond p<0.05,
please sit down and stop pretending you are doing critical analysis.

UNFAMILIAR ≠ WRONG (I can’t believe I have to say this)

Some of you act like if notation doesn’t look exactly like your coursework,
that means the results are wrong.

You reject structure because it’s “weird.”
Jesus Christ.

You’re doing the intellectual equivalent of refusing green food because you’ve never seen it before.

Grow the fuck up.
---
THE FLOATING-POINT RELIGION

Here is another cherished delusion:

Physical constants are arbitrary.
Meaningless.
Fundamentally continuous.
No deeper structure.

You were fed this worldview so deeply that when someone shows you actual compressible and coherent structure?

You panic.

Not because the evidence is weak.
Not because the methods are wrong.

But because your worldview isn’t built to handle “order.”

So you attack me and not the data like I somehow personally offended you. 
Well...fuck you and your little dog brain. 
Be offended. 
Now you have something real to cry about.
Your welcome. 

What some of you do is not skepticism.
What some of you do is straight up textbook indoctrination. 
And a lot of you are nothing more than just good little dogs happy to bark for whoever and whatever you deemed as your masters. 
---
PEER REVIEW IS NOT GOD

Some of you seriously believe that truth doesn’t count until a committee blesses it.

As if the universe waits for referee #2’s email before you can start barking.
As if symmetry breaking requires institutional approval.

You’ll trust a 3-sigma journal paper
before you trust a replicable 18-sigma compression result you can literally test yourself.

You are not upholding rigor.
You are not even trying.
You’re outsourcing your thinking.
---
RATIOS ARE PHYSICS — FLOATS ARE A CRUTCH

Physics has always been ratios, invariants, symmetries.

But the second you see small-denominator rationals show up in fundamental constants—
the second the structure becomes concrete—

you flip the fuck out.

Because you were taught to expect noise.
To expect chaos.
To expect randomness dressed up as precision.

Structure scares you. 
You fear coherence. 
You do not use critical thinking.

That says everything about your training,
and nothing about the work.
---
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS SPELLED OUT VERY SLOWLY

Whether you like this work is irrelevant.
Whether you “feel skeptical” is irrelevant.
Whether it makes you uncomfortable is irrelevant.

You have two options:

1.Run the codes and check my math.

2.Keep talking shit.

Only one of those produces evidence.

BEFORE YOU COMMENT

Please ensure:

⬜ I know what MDL is
⬜ I understand null-modeling
⬜ I know what sigma actually measures
⬜ I understand what “worse than random” means
⬜ I can evaluate logic without checking credentials
⬜ I can separate “this is new” from “this is wrong”

If you cannot check these boxes:

Your confusion is not my problem.

FINAL NOTE

The structure exists.
The compression exists.
The alignment exists.
The sigma exists.
The code exists.
The replication exists.

Your approval?
Absolutely irrelevant.
Kiss my ass! 
I will not stop just because you are uncomfortable. 
Do not call yourself an academic if you behave like this. 
You slander the word.

Run the codes and check the math or shut the fuck up.
