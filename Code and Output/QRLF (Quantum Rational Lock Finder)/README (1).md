# Megacell v13.13.9-onecell-megacell++++ â€” Run Artifacts
This folder contains a full audit trail: config & environment, ledger registry and hashes, and per-section CSV/JSON outputs.

## Contents
- `config.json`: run configuration, seeds, fingerprint, registry hash.
- `environment.json`: Python & NumPy versions, platform info.
- `ledger/`: registry fractions, prereg hash, file SHA256s.
- `sections/`: CSV/JSON exports for candidates, PB tails, FWER, Bayes, predictive holdout, E-values, nearest-dyadic z, cluster LOO, jackknife.

## Verification tips
- Re-run with the same seed to reproduce MC paths.
- Compare `registry_hash` and file SHA256s to validate the prereg ledger.
- Check that section CSVs match the corresponding rows in your console output.
