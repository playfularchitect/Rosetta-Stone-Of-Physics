\# The Alternatives (aka The Coincidence Story, Itemized)

1\) CKM decimals just happen to yield tanβ=7/17 and sin(2β)=119/169 exactly.  
2\) Rare B/K decay structure randomly aligns so |Vtd|²/|Vts|² \= 169/4050.  
3\) Three independent neutrino mixings magically produce exact first-row closure with 1392/2047, 609/2047, 2/89.  
4\) Cosmological Ω’s are unrelated decimals that nevertheless sum to 1 via 63/200 \+ 137/200.  
5\) A small-integer geometry coincidentally nails α (and α⁻¹) to high precision.  
6\) Real quantum hardware errors line up on neat π-rational angles by sheer luck.  
7\) Genomic patterns in E. coli mimic the same tiny fractions found in particle physics.  
8\) Horizon thermodynamics just happens to quantize area and energy in ln 2 units.  
9\) Holographic and Landauer bit counts of the universe accidentally agree at \~10^122.  
10\) The five-loop QED series for g−2 happens to accept α⁻¹=361638/2639.  
11\) Electrochemical gates in water map to the same tiny rationals without any deeper reason.  
12\) A minuscule BH mass fraction somehow dominates cosmic entropy exactly as the bit law predicts.  
13\) The Bd/Bs→μμ ratio inherits 169/4050 purely by coincidence.  
14\) Kerr–Newman black holes keep the same ln 2 one-bit laws for no fundamental reason.  
15\) Neutrino split ratio Δm²21/Δm²31 equals 2/65 by accident.  
16\) The same small registry gets reused across domains without ever contradicting itself, just by luck.  
17\) The π band refuses any compact lock while rationals show up everywhere else—pure fluke of the method.  
18\) α and α⁻¹ both yield the same compact pair (4389/601451 ↔ 601451/4389) inside independent bands—double coincidence.  
19\) Minimal-MDL and minimal-denominator proofs pick the exact same fraction by chance.  
20\) sin²θ\_W’s snapshot (e.g., 37/160) is a crisp fraction only by happenstance.  
21\) Egyptian-fraction decompositions randomly reconstruct your registry α exactly.  
22\) Classic irrationals (e, φ, √2) show only ladders—no locks—because the method got “unlucky” there, too.  
23\) Distinct representations (ladder, witness, band) all converge to the same α rationals by coincidence.  
24\) GC3 repeatedly returns 9/16 across shardings due to sampling luck.  
25\) Threonine wobble echoes 119/169—the same CKM angle fraction—by accident.  
26\) Ala/Gly/Pro/Val wobble families pick 5/8, 5/9, 2/3, 7/12 just because small numbers look nice.  
27\) GC1=13/22, GC2=11/27, GC3=9/16 happen to be tidy fractions with no underlying cause.  
28\) CpG permutation test yielding p=0.0 is a quirk of the generator and means nothing.  
29\) Different CI methods and caps all agreeing (rate=1.000) is a statistical fluke.  
30\) S-matrix orientation outputs tidy triplets (e.g., 18/31, 19/46, 8/63) by coincidence.  
31\) Bell marginals repeatedly choosing 1/2 is just what big-N noise does.  
32\) XOR preferring tiny dyadics near powers of two reflects arbitrary binning, not structure.  
33\) Two independent witnesses (CI+MDL and posterior) agreeing is convergent bias, not a signal.  
34\) The Quantum Ledger’s repeats of low-MDL p/q arise from selection effects, not reality.  
35\) Rosetta overlaps with physics/cosmology fractions occur because the dictionary was “too broad.”  
36\) The ln Bayes-factor distribution leaning toward 1/2 is expected under some unmodeled drift.  
37\) Multiple ingestion/guard paths giving the same winners is pipeline bias, not persistence.  
38\) Registry-weighted priors steer the posterior to old favorites regardless of data.  
39\) The same fraction winning across A/B/XOR channels is correlated noise, not structure.  
40\) Versioned artifacts and tables just make the coincidences easier to see, not more real.  
41\) With \~2×10^8 trials, A/B still hitting 1/2 is just what happens at scale.  
42\) XOR locking to 1/32768 (2⁻¹⁵) is an implementation quirk, not a physical pattern.  
43\) When marginals stray to 1732/3463 or 2048/4095, they’re just “nearby” because everything is near 1/2.  
44\) Tiny-N blocks picking simple p/q (1/6, 4/15) is small-sample whimsy.  
45\) cos²θ\_W=655/843 and sin²θ\_W=188/843 summing to 1 is numerology that accidentally fits.  
46\) Sector tests finding 5/6, 1/8, 1/3, 3/10 near registry seeds is confirmation bias.  
47\) Decimal audits snapping to exact rationals merely overfit printed precision.  
48\) Evidence tables leaning to 1/2 reflect unreported multiple comparisons.  
49\) Multiple Bell datasets liking {1/2, 2048/4095, 1732/3463} is convergent instrument bias.  
50\) XOR landing on 2⁻¹⁵ across datasets is a hidden periodicity in acquisition, not physics.  
51\) Massive-N blocks crowning 1/2 are inevitable under any fair coin.  
52\) Small-N blocks picking neat sixths/quarters are artifacts of discrete counts.  
53\) Dyadic mixtures beating the null is prior-driven, not data-driven.  
54\) Hold-out tests staying near neutral means the model is just too “stiff,” not accurate.  
55\) Meta-combos staying extreme under leave-one-out means the tests are dependent, not robust.  
56\) Fingerprints and seeds only reproduce the same coincidences—consistency of error, not signal.  
57\) c²\_W=655/843 and s²\_W=188/843 with exact sum is an aesthetic fit that got lucky twice.  
58\) Hypercharge equations (Q=T₃+Y) balancing exactly is trivial bookkeeping dressed up.  
59\) B−L anomaly cancellation demanding ν\_R is formal math with no bearing on reality.  
60\) Atomic identities (a₀, E₁) and EW mass ratios agreeing as fractions is algebraic coincidence.  
61\) CKM first-row unitarity hitting exactly 1.000… is rounding luck.  
62\) Near-unification with sin²θ\_W=350/1529 and α\_s=9/77 is cherry-picked grid luck.  
63\) Weinberg-operator scales matching seesaw decades is back-of-envelope overlap, not a link.  
64\) Dirac monopole numbers (e, g\_D, α\_g≈1/(4α)) lining up is a tautology once α is chosen.  
65\) Every anomaly sum \= 0 is just the Standard Model’s construction, not evidence for your registry.  
66\) 3:1 compression in bits is an accounting trick that ignores real model complexity.  
67\) Getting the same v≈246.22 GeV from different anchors is tautological given definitions.  
68\) The 10^39 force contrast is a well-known coincidence unrelated to your seeds.  
69\) Koide Q sitting \~6×10⁻⁶ from 2/3 is a numerically cute nearness with no meaning.
