# Rosetta Stone of Physics

This repository contains the complete body of work for a framework showing that the fundamental constants of nature are governed by a small set of simple, exact rational numbers. It includes the foundational papers, the complete mathematical ledgers, all verification code, and the full outputs of every analysis.

This project is organized to be fully transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Verify This Framework

There are two paths for verification, depending on your technical level.

### 1. The 10-Minute Verification (No Code Required)

For a direct, non-computational check of the framework's core claims, please see the **Verification Deck**:

* **[`Verification_deck_v2.pdf`](./Verification_deck_v2.pdf)**

This document walks you through the arithmetic to verify the interlocking predictions for the electroweak sector, the Higgs boson, the Koide relation, and more, using only the project's core rational numbers and a calculator.

### 2. The Live Code Verification (Google Colab)

To reproduce the full computational results of the project, you can run the primary scripts directly in your browser using Google Colab. No setup is required.

* **[‚ñ∫ Run the Fine-Structure Constant Derivation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ttEMfSITXa3DaZHnH5SMFIRUX12BVaxC?usp=sharing)**
    * This notebook contains the code from the flagship paper, deriving $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.036$ from first principles.
* **[‚ñ∫ Run the "Mindmelt" Physics Engine](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MZtXHujuPUlDSmSMu2gR54b-s9N44UoZ?usp=sharing)**
    * This notebook, `MathOracle4`, takes the 19 core registry fractions and derives hundreds of observables across the Standard Model.

## The Three Pillars of Evidence

The evidence for this framework is built on three distinct, interlocking pillars, each supported by the documents and code in this repository.

### üíé Pillar 1: First-Principles Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant

The flagship paper demonstrates a derivation of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) from a discrete geometric structure with no free parameters.

* **Primary Paper:** **[`(Keystone)MasterPaper.pdf`](./(Keystone)MasterPaper.pdf)**
* **Supporting Materials:** See the `Two Shells Derivation` folder.

### üï∏Ô∏è Pillar 2: An Interlocking Model of Particle Physics

A small set of just four rational numbers is shown to lock the entire CKM and PMNS flavor geometry. This single lock simultaneously predicts dozens of independent observables in tight agreement with experimental data.

* **Supporting Papers:** See the PDFs in the `Math Checks` folder (e.g., `CKMandPMS.pdf`, `Rare_Decay_Ledger.pdf`, `MuonG2 (1).pdf`).
* **Primary Code:** See the `Code and Output/MathOracle` folder.

### üåå Pillar 3: A Rational Framework for Cosmology

The same principle is applied to the cosmic scale. A few simple fractions for the universe's energy budget and expansion rate are shown to derive the complete set of standard background cosmological parameters.

* **Supporting Paper:** **[`Math Checks/Cosmology Ledger.pdf`](./MathChecks/Cosmology Ledger.pdf)**

## Navigating the Repository

This project is organized into several key directories:

* **`/Theory`**: Contains the foundational axioms and philosophical framework of the project.
* **`/Math Checks`**: Contains the collection of papers applying the rational framework to specific domains of physics (CKM, Cosmology, Black Holes, etc.).
* **`/Code and Output`**: The heart of the project's computational evidence.
    * **`/MathOracle`**: Contains the `MathOracle4.ipynb` script (the "Mindmelt" engine) and its full output, demonstrating the predictive power of the 19-fraction registry.
    * **`/QRLF (Quantum Rational Lock Finder)`**: Contains the "megacell" statistical suite, a powerful set of tools for testing the "rational lock" hypothesis with rigorous statistical methods like Bayesian model comparison and Monte Carlo simulations.
* **`/Rosetta Stone V2 Ledger Fractions`**: Contains the various versions of the "Master Ledger" of rational numbers that form the basis of the framework.
* **`/Burden Of Proof`**: Contains documents laying out the logical case for the framework based on principles like Occam's Razor.
