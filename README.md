Even if you dont agree with my logic, the math is math. Either show an inconsistency or join the team.
Reality is not built from “stuff,” but from the endless oscillation of paradox within infinite...nothing and something flipping to define each other.

TL:Dr: 
Compression ratio: ~10⁹ possible fractions searched, yet the best fit for every constant needs only 7-digit integers.
•  Residuals: every one < 1 σ, several < 0.3 σ. That’s wildly unlikely if the true values were “generic” irrationals.
•  Predictive edge: g-2 (FNAL 2024, 1.2 σ tension erased), Lamb shift, Λ already post-dicted within new data, plus a pending α_s shift.
DO NOT hang your skepticism on the wrong hook please.
Whether or not there is a fancy manifold behind the curtain (there is check theory section please), the raw fact that 19 rational numbers with ≤ 7 digit denominators sit inside every experimental bound to < 1 σ is itself a jaw dropping regularity. 

Theoretical framework that predicts the 19 rational numbers before any brute force fit. Check medium articles and dates released. The brute force step is merely selecting the minimal integers consistent with that analytic derivation.

In the Code and Output Folder there is a Ledger Code stuff Folder that contains:

Hard, mathematical evidence that the fundamental constants are not a random collection of numbers, but are instead interconnected parts of a single, underlying algebraic architecture.

**Claim**  
If you fix a single ruler \(v\) and store the Standard Model snapshot as exact fractions, you can reproduce real observables with basic arithmetic. Don’t like the philosophy? Fine. The math is the math. Either break the numbers or accept that a big slice of your field compresses to ratios.

**Verify in under a minute**  
Open `verification_deck_v2.pdf`. It walks through the checks directly from the fraction table: the VEV from \(M_W\), \(M_Z\) and \(M_H\) predictions, the collider-level \(H\to\tau\tau\) width and branching ratio, the custodial snapshot, hydrogen’s ground state, Koide, and anomaly cancellation. No code required; just arithmetic with the provided ratios.

**Core artifacts (this repo)**  
Code lives in `mathoracle4(finalcell).py`.  
Outputs from a full run live in `mindmelt_output_20250823-020454.txt`.  
“How to do math with fractions” lives in the `Physics To Fractions` folder.  
A compact, human-readable proof pack lives in `verification_deck_tex.pdf`.
Foundational Axioms from Theory section are distilled into 5 easy principles.

**Run it live (Colab)**  
The most recent one-cell runner is at the link below. Open it, run from top to bottom, and compare printed tables with the PDF deck.
