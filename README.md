# Rosetta-Stone-Of-Physics
Even if you dont agree with my logic, the math is math. Either prove I am wrong or accept that I am right.
Reality is not built from “stuff,” but from the endless oscillation of paradox within infinite...nothing and something flipping to define each other.

# Rosetta-Stone-Of-Physics

**Claim**  
If you fix a single ruler \(v\) and store the Standard Model snapshot as exact fractions, you can reproduce real observables with basic arithmetic. Don’t like the philosophy? Fine. The math is the math. Either break the numbers or accept that a big slice of your field compresses to ratios.

**Verify in under a minute**  
Open `verification_deck_tex.pdf`. It walks through the checks directly from the fraction table: the VEV from \(M_W\), \(M_Z\) and \(M_H\) predictions, the collider-level \(H\to\tau\tau\) width and branching ratio, the custodial snapshot, hydrogen’s ground state, Koide, and anomaly cancellation. No code required; just arithmetic with the provided ratios.

**Core artifacts (this repo)**  
Code lives in `mathoracle4.py`.  
Outputs from a full run live in `mindmelt_output_20250823-020454.txt`.  
“How to do math with fractions” lives in the `Physics To Fractions` folder.  
A compact, human-readable proof pack lives in `verification_deck_tex.pdf`.

**Run it live (Colab)**  
The most recent one-cell runner is at the link below. Open it, run from top to bottom, and compare printed tables with the PDF deck.
