# Rosetta Stone of Physics

A framework showing that the fundamental constants of nature are governed by a small set of simple, exact rational numbers. This repository contains the papers, data, and code that form the complete, verifiable evidence for this claim.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Live Verification

Open the Google Colab notebook below to run the main verification script. It will reproduce the key tables and results from the `mathoracle4(finalcell).py` script.

(Note: The final, correct cell is at the bottom of the notebook. The other cells are previous iterations you are free to explore.) No setup is required.

## The Three Pillars of Evidence

The evidence for this framework is built on three distinct, interlocking pillars.

### üíé Pillar 1: First-Principles Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant

The flagship paper demonstrates a derivation of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) from a discrete geometric structure with no free parameters, yielding **$\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.03600058$**.

### üï∏Ô∏è Pillar 2: An Interlocking Model of Particle Physics

A small set of just four rational numbers is shown to lock the entire CKM and PMNS flavor geometry. This single lock simultaneously predicts dozens of independent observables in tight agreement with experimental data. (See the `Math Checks` and `Physics To Fractions` folders in this repository for details.)

### üåå Pillar 3: A Rational Framework for Cosmology

The same principle is applied to the cosmic scale. A few simple fractions for the universe's energy budget and expansion rate are shown to derive the complete set of standard background cosmological parameters. (See the `Math Checks` and `Physics To Fractions` folders.)

## Navigating This Project

### How to Verify the Interlocking (10 Minutes, No Code Required)

Open **`verification_deck_v2.pdf`**. It walks through the checks directly from the fraction table: the VEV from \(M_W\), \(M_Z\) and \(M_H\) predictions, the collider-level \(H\to\tau\tau\) width and branching ratio, the custodial snapshot, hydrogen‚Äôs ground state, Koide, and anomaly cancellation. All you need is a calculator.
