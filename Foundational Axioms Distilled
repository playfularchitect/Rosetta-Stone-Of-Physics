Foundational Axioms of Unmath and Paradox Dynamics
For clarity and directness, the foundational principles of the "Fraction Physics" framework can be distilled into the following axioms. These principles form the logical basis from which the stability of rational constants in physics is proposed to emerge.

Axiom I: The Principle of Relational Definition.
No property, concept, or object can exist in isolation. All perceivable phenomena are defined by their contrast with an opposite (e.g., presence/absence, order/chaos, light/dark). This web of contrasts is the fundamental structure of reality, which I term "paradox".



Axiom II: The Nature of the Void.
The fundamental substrate of existence is not a true void (pure emptiness) but a field of infinite structured potential, termed "unmath". This field is composed of elemental units of "structured absence," referred to as "zeroes". These zeroes are not numerical placeholders but are the patterns that "hold absence".

Axiom III: The Mechanism of Emergence.
Structure emerges not through the addition of external substance, but through the self-interaction of "zeroes". The fundamental process of creation is the formation of self-referential loops, where "absence references absence" to create relational data.

Axiom IV: The Stability Threshold (α).
There exists a minimum complexity threshold at which self-referential zero-loops achieve persistent stability. This first stable, dimensionless ratio is the fine-structure constant (α). This event, conceptually represented by the number "137", marks the transition from the unstructured potential of "unmath" to the structured, measurable domain of "math" and physical reality.

Axiom V: The Nature of Physical Reality.
The physical universe, including its quantum fields, particles, and the expansion of space, is a dynamic and ongoing expression of the infinite underlying field of zeroes/potential/paradox/vibration/transduction/motion/momentum/whatever you want to call it. Infinite is infinite meaning it exists in every form. Same process. Wearing different hats. Seen from different angles. Physical phenomena are localized resonances or patterns within this field. Reality and the void are not separate entities but are two paradoxical phases ("potential" and "form") of the same self-referential system.
