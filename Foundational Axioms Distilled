Foundational Axioms of Unmath and Paradox Dynamics
For clarity and directness, the foundational principles of the "Fraction Physics" framework can be distilled into the following axioms. These principles form the logical basis from which the stability of rational constants in physics is proposed to emerge.

Axiom I: The Principle of Relational Definition.
No property, concept, or object can exist in isolation. All perceivable phenomena are defined by their contrast with an opposite (e.g., presence/absence, order/chaos, light/dark). This web of contrasts is the fundamental structure of reality, which I term "paradox".



Axiom II: The Nature of the Void.
The fundamental substrate of existence is not a true void (pure emptiness) but a field of infinite structured potential, termed "unmath". This field is composed of elemental units of "structured absence," referred to as "zeroes". These zeroes are not numerical placeholders but are the patterns that "hold absence".

Axiom III: The Mechanism of Emergence.
Structure emerges not through the addition of external substance, but through the self-interaction of "zeroes". The fundamental process of creation is the formation of self-referential loops, where "absence references absence" to create relational data.

Axiom IV: The Stability Threshold (α).
There exists a minimum complexity threshold at which self-referential zero-loops achieve persistent stability. This first stable, dimensionless ratio is the fine-structure constant (α). This event, conceptually represented by the number "137", marks the transition from the unstructured potential of "unmath" to the structured, measurable domain of "math" and physical reality.

Axiom V: The Nature of Physical Reality.
The physical universe, including its quantum fields, particles, and the expansion of space, is a dynamic and ongoing expression of the infinite underlying field of zeroes/potential/paradox/vibration/transduction/recursion/motion/momentum/whatever you want to call it. Infinite is infinite meaning it exists in every form. Same process. Wearing different hats. Seen from different angles. Physical phenomena are localized resonances or patterns within this field. Reality and the void are not separate entities but are two paradoxical phases ("potential" and "form") of the same self-referential system.

FOR ULTRA CLARIFICATION....

I had someone email me with a question and I figured I would post this for anyone else who may be not be sure what I am directly showing:

The Central Thesis: Reality is not composed of "things," but of relational differences — up/down, hot/cold, something/nothing. These differences are not separate entities but two sides of a single,infinite, dynamic process: Paradox (Or infinite, but I use paradox for clarity. I genuinely mean that reality is an infinite process, expressing itself in infinite ways. Think of infinite as potential. The field of potential is one side and we are the other side of the same process,aka realized potential. And both are nested with one another and can effect one another. I am realized potential made from the field of unrealized potential, with the ability to wield potential. Everything is the same exact process, seen from different angles, wearing different hats.

The Genesis of Form: So essentially the way I collapsse it into a binary without losing the infinite is by understanding that the ultimate paradox is “Nothing.” True nothingness is impossible to conceive without creating “something.” This “structured absence” inevitably generates the first difference, the first vibration, the first rational ratio. The universe bootstraps itself out of the tension between opposites.

The Implication for Physics: If reality is fundamentally relational and paradoxical, then its most fundamental description should be in terms of ratios and relationships (fractions), not absolute, floating point quantities. The Fraction Physics project is the mathematical expression of this metaphysical principle.
