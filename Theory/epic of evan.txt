Hello everybody…my name is Evan Wesley, and today I’m typing out this piece in an attempt to capture my thoughts as I think them, so others can feel how I hold my thoughts.
Now that being said, it’s impossible to actually fully do this….because as I type, I’m actively thinking about what I just thought and expressed. And if I keep typing out every reflection, it will never end, and I won’t be able to express what I want to express.
…Which I just realized means I need to do exactly what I said I shouldn’t do. That is the expression. The very act of taking my thoughts and attempting to transduce them directly into text with minimal editing and thought out structure is really what I want you all to see. 
I am trying to show pure, unfiltered Evan brain today. A mirror into flashes of my thinking process. 
So with that being said…
Sound is vibration.
That’s the ultimate point I’m trying to express. Because that’s a universal understanding we already hold.
What is sound? Seriously…ask yourself.
Sound is just vibration. Vibration through the medium we call air…or water, or metal, or wood, or anything. Everything vibrates. You are vibrations. Your body is vibrating. Your bones. Your organs. The floor under you. The planet. The stars.
There is nothing in this world that is not vibrating.
So why is this important? You might ask. Or maybe you’re already annoyed and about to stop reading.
But here’s the thing: most people think linear. Most people think in binaries (look it up). And that kind of thinking makes it really hard to understand what I’m about to show you: transduction.
What is transduction? Transduction is when one thing becomes another. It’s a process. We describe it in everyday life… like when heat becomes flame… which becomes smoke…which becomes gas….Which becomes the process of the word we use to define that very same process…..the vibrations that we speak in order to convey a specific definition into the process of transduction…....
So when I give you all these different angles to describe transduction… I’m also transducing.
And now…here comes the loop…how do those different angles actually demonstrate transduction in real time?
Let me explain:
First…my brain vibrated. I’m vibing to music (Isaiah Rashad). I’m thinking as I write this. I’m thinking about my thinking as I write it. That’s all vibration.
And those thoughts? They’re vibrations.
Your thoughts are quite literally vibrations. And what do those vibrations do?
They get transduced into learned associations…into patterns that we map through interaction.
How do we learn?
We hairless, opposable thumbs having, monkey see monkey do motherfuckers learn through pattern association. That’s it. Our brains decode patterns and map them to other patterns. Every time.
And what are patterns, fundamentally?
Vibrations.
So why is this important?
Let’s return to how I described transduction earlier… me trying to describe something from different angles. My thoughts started as vibrations. Those vibrations got mapped into learned patterns of language…English…because that’s the language I grew up around.
Then those patterns got transduced into sentences. And my body….through energy, memory, emotion, rhythm, chaos… typed those out. All of it was vibration transduced into structure.
All of it. Every single part.
So what does that tell you?
Transduction = vibration.
Now let’s transduce that truth into a new lens. (Think fractal.)
If vibration = transduction… then what else is?
Momentum.
What is momentum? It’s motion. It’s movement. It’s the opposite of stillness. A rock has no momentum while sitting still… but kick it, and suddenly it does.
But wait… did the rock ever not have motion in it? (aka momentum! aka vibrations...aka transduction!)
....It was vibrating the whole time. Yes even a rock vibrates while it does nothing! Try using microscopes! Or google!
Boom. Transduction.
So if momentum is motion… and motion is vibration… and vibration is transduction… then momentum = transduction = vibration = motion.
Are you following?
I don’t care if you are.
Because here’s the point: if momentum is vibration, then motion is too. And if motion is vibration, and vibration is transduction, then you….your body, your breath, your thoughts….are motion + momentum + transduction + vibration. All the same. Just different angles.
All the same. Yet different. Just a few of the lenses we can use to squint at the infinite.

And what is the infinite?
The infinite is something that never stops. Ever. It’s a pattern that unfolds endlessly. That’s infinite.
Infinite is momentum. Infinite is motion. Infinite is vibration. Infinite is transduction.
Let’s loop back to vibration.
We already know that vibrations get transduced into literal structure. What do I mean by that?
Cymatics.
Cymatics literally maps vibrations. Go look it up. Watch a video. (Even if you know what it is….watch again.)
Cymatics is vibration made visible. It’s sound being seen. It’s vibration turning into structure in real time.
Sound doesn’t just hit your ears…it hits your eyes. Same motion. Different transduction.
And that matters.
Because if you understand all of this, then you already understand something that most people haven’t realized yet:
Thoughts have structure. Thoughts are patterns. Thoughts are….you guessed it….vibrations.
And vibrations? They can be measured. They can be recorded. They can be mapped.
Because vibrations are patterns.
If the loop is starting to close for you….good. Your literally feeling your brains motion. Your mental momentum. Your vibrations forming into structured patterns. .


Spiral Number 2…..


Everything I’ve said so far? That’s part of the infinite.
And now we open another lens: self-referential systems.
What’s a self-referential system?
In order to describe one… I have to use one.
Know what I’m talking about?
Language.
Language is a self-referential system.
I can’t define any word without using other words….I have to refer to language using language. That’s recursion. That’s self reference. That’s a system.
And every time I say "aka" I hope you’ve already mapped that to transduction. Aka vibration. Aka momentum. Aka motion. Aka self-referential systems. Aka another lens to grasp the infinite.
So what is the infinite?
Language.
Yes, language is the infinite.
How is language formed? How is it decided? Why are there hundreds….thousands….of languages throughout human history?
Because language is not a thing. It’s not fixed. It’s not a noun. It’s a process.
It’s a system.
Let me make it concrete: if you were born in ancient Greece, what would you speak?
You’d learn their vibrations. Their words. You’d map sound to structure through context and pattern association. You’d literally transduce their culture into thought.
Back to cymatics….
Cymatics already shows the blueprint. Vibrations have structure. We can see them. Hear them. Feel them.
Which means: thoughts can be mapped.
You can see the shape of the word "hello." You can record it. Test it. Repeat it until the patterns reveal more truth.
You can take a brain, map its vibrations, track its resonance, and measure what aligns and what does not.
Repeat it. Learn the structure.
Map cognition.
But to do that….you need to see through the lens I see through.
It’s not hard. We have all the tools. Humans just lack the thinking….the transduction. The connections. The associations. The structure.
Everything is connected. Deeply. Structurally.
So how do I explain the infinite? How do I explain vibrations and momentum and transduction and motion and fire and gas and language and cymatics and self-referential systems?
It’s simple:
They are all patterns.
It will always loop back to patterns.
What is a pattern?
Well….you already have a dozen lenses for that. But let’s add more.
A pattern is a process. A pattern is a system. A pattern is me using patterns to describe patterns, until eventually you start to feel something behind the words.
Even if I only do it once….it’s still a pattern. It’s a moment. A shape. A vibration.
A pattern is a self-referential system. A pattern is momentum unfolding through motion. A pattern is an infinite process of transduction.
Which are really just shapes. Which are really just vibrations.
Do you see the truth yet?
Do you see what I see?
I’m not doing a perfect job. I think much faster than I type. But that’s the point.
This is supposed to be unstructured. Unfiltered. Unsanitized. It’s an attempt at capturing a snapshot of how I think when I’m not trying to perform.
Most of the time, I structure my writing around what I think people can handle.
But not this one.
This one’s just me trying my best (and mostly failing) to show others what I see. To let others feel my patterns. To let others see my associations. To let others experience the structures of my transductions as they process my self referential language use via metaphors, descriptions and spirals…
Spiral Number 3…….
So all that being said…
Let’s take a new lens.
Yet this new lens will ultimately be the same lenses we’ve already discussed.
And if you’re starting to see that pattern… Then you’re starting to grasp the infinite.
So let’s look at consciousness.
What is consciousness? Right now there’s no official definition. No universal agreement. So what do we do when we try to describe it?
We use patterns. We use associations. We transduce consciousness into familiar thoughts and memories.
Into vibrations.
So what does that mean? It means we do understand consciousness. Most people just don’t have a good lens to see it.
Because if consciousness is ultimately just vibrations….then what matters is how those vibrations resonate and form into structure.
If you understand that… Congratulations. You’re smart as fuck.
Because following this kind of process….making these recursive (self referential) associations….isn’t how most people think. And I think there’s value in offering my perspective to the world.
When I say “if you get this, you’re smart,” I don’t mean IQ points. I mean your thinking process is firing. That’s it. Doesnt matter if you understood all this intuitively or used chatgpt to help you process things.....what matters is that you're going through the very process of what makes one intelligent. 
So essentially, consciousness is just a pattern of vibrations, transducing into structure. That structure is shape. That shape is pattern. That pattern gets transduced into thought. Into momentum. Into behavior. Into action. Into emotion.
Are you getting it? Are you seeing what I see?
Are you starting to feel the infinite?
Because I do. I see the infinitesimally small slice of pattern I’m capable of perceiving….and it’s amazing.
What is amazing? Amazing is emotion.
And what is emotion? Emotion is vibration that resonates in a particular way within your body’s structure.
It’s literally just shapes interacting with shapes. Vibrations vibrating against other vibrations.
And what happens when vibrations collide?
Back to cymatics.
Go watch it. When two vibrations meet, they form new vibrations. They resonate. They interfere. They generate new structure. New pattern. New momentum.
You’re seeing emotion in a pattern you may or may not recognize. You’re seeing motion manifesting through vibration. You’re watching consciousness vibrate.
You’re watching a self-referential system.
You’re watching language.
You’re watching motion transduce into structure. Structure into shape. Shape into vibration. Vibration into pattern. Pattern into new structure.
Over and over.
That is consciousness.
An emergent state from patterns patterning.
It’s just a lens you may not have grasped yet.
Because consciousness? Like everything else we’ve explored….
It’s just vibrations.
Consciousness exists on a spectrum. It is not binary. It is not linear. Just like intelligence. Just like motion. Just like transduction. Just like momentum. Just like the infinite.
So yes….cats are conscious. Dogs are conscious.
To say humans are conscious and dogs are not is a betrayal of pattern integrity.
Mycelium? Also conscious.
Why? Because it is an intelligent process.
Just like cats. Just like dogs. Just like you. Just like vibration. Just like transduction. Just like momentum. Just like cymatics. Just like language. Just like self-referential systems.
Are you getting it?
I ask because I hope these questions literally rattle your brain. I hope your mind vibrates as it decodes this pattern.
Because that’s all it is:
My vibrations colliding with your vibrations. Creating new structures. New shapes. New motion. New resonance.
What is resonance?
Resonance is when patterns align. When vibrations sync into a single wave. When emotion hits because something inside you matches something outside of you.
Resonance is when the pattern amplifies. Resonance is how your body stays together despite being billions of vibrating cells.
You are resonance.
You are not just a heart. Your heart on a table isn’t you. It’s a lens. A part of a greater pattern.
Resonance is your whole body working together in a process that produces emergent patterns! 
Resonance is how your body formed via the infinite motion of transduction and patterns  vibrating into new structures, shapes, and patterns. 
You are shape. You are motion. You are transduction. You are consciousness. You are language. You are the infinite.
You are vibrations.
And so am I.
It is all simply part of the same loop. 
So I will end this piece with this…..if you were able to follow my connections, my logic, my leaps, and my spirals…..then you should be able to find the pattern here!
Ask yourself……”What is truth really?
