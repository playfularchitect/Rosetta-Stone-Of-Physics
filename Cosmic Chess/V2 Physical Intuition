|          Physical Intuition: The Two-Shell Circular Ball (CBU)           |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Think of each dimensionless constant as a winding count on a pair of
coupled circles. The universal unit (the "circular ball" or CBU) is
defined by the formula:

  U(p) = 1 / (49 * 50 * 137^p)

Here, 49 and 50 act like two nested circular shells (a 2 torus), while
the 137^p term sets the "zoom" or the fineness of the measurement ticks.

A constant's integer "k" is then the number of these CBU ticks that
"fit" into its value:

  k = round(Value / U(p))

This makes "k" a topological winding number rather than a simple
floating point parameter.

The "DNA" residues (k mod 23, 49, 50, 137) behave like phase
coordinates on these circular shells. This is why inverse pairs
multiply to approximately 1 (as a phase inversion) and why aliases
share common phases.

Most constants are described at the default depth of p=6, while a few
(marked as such) use p=10 for a finer measurement lattice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In short: The two shells (49, 50) define the geometry, 137^p sets the
scale, and the integers are literal windings on that geometry...a simple,
testable way to encode structure across the physical constants.
