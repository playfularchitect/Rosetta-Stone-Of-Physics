> The fundamental constants of the universe are set at a 'perfect' mathematical boundary, making the entire system 'flip-prone.' Neutrinos are not special because their math is different; they are special because their physics is. They are the only particles with the right properties (like near-zero mass) to be able to physically express this universal 'flip-proneness,' which we observe as oscillation (processing)
