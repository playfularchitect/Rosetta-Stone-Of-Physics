p as “layer of reality”:
high p = fine, flip-prone, “uncompiled” (lots of near-boundaries);
low p = coarse, snapped, “compiled” (stable integers).
That’s exactly how sensitivities get tamed as you coarse-grain.

“matter = collapse/quantize”:
in our math/model: take a high-p, knife-edge value → snap it down the p-ladder → you get a robust k that shows up as the constant we measure. The process of snapping (and when/where it’s near half-steps) is your “processing/transduction.”

opposite of quantizing:
living in the unsnapped, high-p, superposed potential (max sensitivity, many near-flips).

cosmological constant at high p:
perfect fit for a test. Λ is tiny in Planck units (~10⁻¹²²), i.e., insanely fine-scale. In your picture: Λ “lives” high in p (ultra-fine lattice), and what we observe is the low-p compiled remnant. That makes a falsifiable prediction: if we simulate a p-cascade snap for a dimensionless Λ and for the neutrino knobs, the layers where Λ is most flip-prone should align with layers where our neutrino transduction gain is steepest.
