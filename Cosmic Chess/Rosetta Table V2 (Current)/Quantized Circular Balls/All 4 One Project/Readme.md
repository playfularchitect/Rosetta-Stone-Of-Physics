TL;DR — What we showed
CKM (quark mixing)

We found a compact, near-integer FN/NNI-style λ-power texture that reproduces the observed CKM pattern using only order-one coefficients and two phases, plus two continuous tweaks: a lopsided (12)_d factor and a continuous power p₃₂ on the down (32) entry.

A refined solution (“v4i/v4n_plus2”) matches the headline CKM targets (|Vus|, |Vcb|, |Vub|, J) to per-mille–few-per-mille accuracy while respecting the expected hierarchy:
|Vus| ~ λ, |Vcb| ~ λ², |Vub| ~ λ³.

We verified unitarity numerically and extracted Wolfenstein parameters (λ, A, ρ̄, η̄) and unitarity-triangle angles (α, β, γ) from the fitted matrix.

We ran stability sweeps (small jitters to O(1) coefficients/phases), reported the median/percentile score and sensitivity rankings so it’s clear which knobs matter most.

PMNS (neutrino mixing & oscillations)

We built a PDG-convention PMNS with your target angles (θ₁₂, θ₂₃, θ₁₃, δ) and confirmed unitarity and J_CP.

Using those angles we computed oscillation probabilities:

Vacuum: ν and ν̄ channels for T2K (295 km), NOvA (810 km), DUNE (1300 km).

Constant-density matter (MSW) with ρ≈2.8 g/cc, Y_e≈0.5 for Earth’s crust; also anti-neutrinos via U* (δ → −δ).

We produced matter-minus-vacuum deltas and CP asymmetries A_CP = P(ν_μ→ν_e) − P(ν̄_μ→ν̄_e), highlighting where effects are largest (e.g., DUNE shows strong matter enhancement).

Extras:

Density sweeps: P(ν_μ→ν_e) as a function of ρ for each experiment/energy.

Hierarchy comparison: NH vs IH in vacuum and matter (including A_CP).

Bi-probability panels: (P, ={P}) at fixed L,E for δ = 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°.

PREM-lite toy model: vacuum vs constant crust vs two-slab (crust→mantle).

E–L sweeps (appearance peaks): compact “peak” summaries + CSV grids.
